          <h3>Rugby Reekers</h3>
          <div class="content">
            <p>From the feet of those legends with the oval balls, socks that have been through the rough
              and tumble of the heavy duty storm soaked mucky pitches. <br><br>
              These are collectors items, coming with certificate of assurance that they have been through our unique dry-sweating process.
              <br><br>
              Soaked with match day rain and sweat, dried then worn again. This dry-sweating process is repeated over and over until the stench
              meets our highest "Gold Star" Reek standard.
